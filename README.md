# My personal page 2.0

Hi, I decided to keep my personal page code open for anybody interested in my stack: Laravel + Heroku. 
I have a long list of features that I'd like to develop/deploy, but I'm going to deliver them incrementally, so I'll update it weekly and always bring something new.

Backlog
-------
+ Migrate all blade files to Vue.js
+ Host all assets in a CDN 
+ SPA
