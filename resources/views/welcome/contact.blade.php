                <p>Have a question or want to work together? Well, If you have an application you are interested in developing with web technology, I’d love to work with you on it. I’m a full-stack developer which means I can bring your project from concept to completion. I work primarily with Django and Node.js on the back-end and Ember.js on the front-end but picking up new languages or frameworks isn’t a problem. </p>
                <p>The best way to prove an idea is turning it into a reality in the simplest way possible. Let's get in touch!</p>
